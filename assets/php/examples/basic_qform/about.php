	<h1>About Sections 4 - 10</h1>

	<p>Sections 4 through 10 focus on the <strong>QForm</strong> and the <strong>QControl</strong> libraries.  In order
		to focus on just the view and controller layer functionality that QForms offers, the concepts of
		code generated objects and components are only discussed minimally.</p>

	<p>Any examples that utilize code generated objects (which subsequently is using the database)
		will be marked with a "*".  If you would like more information on how these objects are
		generated or how they work, we recommend that you check out sections 1 - 3 of the examples.</p>
