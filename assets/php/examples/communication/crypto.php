	<h1>Implementing Cryptography</h1>

	<p>The <strong>Cryptography</strong> class is used to implement cryptography for your site and
		back-end. Cryptography uses methods from the <strong>openssl</strong> library integrated into PHP </p>

	<p>By default, <strong>Cryptography</strong> will use the <strong>AES 256-bit</strong> cipher in <strong>CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)</strong> mode.
        We choose AES-256-CBC because it is a strong cipher and is recommended by the US government for it's own secret documents and hence is widely accepted too.
        Cryptography can also conveniently do base64 conversion (similar to MIME-based
		Base64 encoding) so that the resulting encrypted data can be used in text-based streams,
		GET/POST data, URLs, etc.  By default Base64 encoding is enabled, since we mostly deal with HTTP on the web and it's just easier to transport text than binary.</p>

	<p>However, note that any of these options can be changed at any time.  Through the <strong>openssl</strong>
		library, <strong>Cryptography</strong> supports most of the industry accepted ciphers. You can use the
        <strong><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-get-cipher-methods.php" target="_blank">openssl-get-cipher-methods</a></strong>
        method to see the list of supported encryption methods.</p>

	<p>You can specify a "default" cipher, base64 flag, key and initialization vector by modifying
		the arguments when constructing a new instance of <strong>\QCubed\Cryptography</strong>.</p>

	<p><em>Asymmetric Cryptography (using public-private key pairs) is not yet supported.</em></p>

	<p><strong>Cryptography</strong> also supports the encryption and decryption of entire files.</p>

	<p>By default, the QCubed framework is not set up with a default cryptography key. You can set one up for your application by
        defining the <strong>QCUBED_CRYPTOGRAPHY_DEFAULT_KEY</strong> define. By sure to keep this key private.

    <h2>The Initialization Vector</h2>
    Some ciphers require an initialization vector. An initialization vector is an important part of preventing someone
    from being able to guess your key from a series of encrypted data. Initialization vectors must be random, and should
    be remembered. Generally speaking, you should let the Cryptography class handle the creation and management of
    the initialization vector for you by specifying null. It will embed the initialization vector into the encrtypted data
    (which is fine and does not compromise the data, it just makes it longer). Only in special situations where you are
    trying to limit the size of encrypted data would you need to manage the IV yourself.
