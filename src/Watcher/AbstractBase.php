 * Class QWatcherBase
 *
 * QWatcher is a helper class that allows controls and forms to watch database tables
 * and automatically redraw when changes are detected. It works together with the codegened
 * model classes, the controls, and the QForm class to draw or refresh when needed.
 *
 * Static functions handle the database updating, while member variables store the current state
 * of a control's watched tables.
 *
 * This Base class is a template on which to build watchers that use specific caching mechanisms.
 * See QWatcher to select the caching mechanism you would like to use.
