#Jquery UI Controls

The "Gen" controls are generated by scripts found in the 
`tools/jquery_ui_gen` directory. These scripts scrape the JQuery UI Web site to 
create a basic interface to accessing the JQuery UI controls. 
The "Base" controls provide additional enhancements to make the controls more QCubed 
friendly. In the Project directory, you will find controls the inherit from the base
control and that let you further modify the controls.
