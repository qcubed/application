 * in the /tools/jquery_ui_gen/jq_control_gen.php file
 * and you can regenerate the files if you need to.

 * The comments in this file are taken from the api reference site, so they do
 * not always make sense with regard to QCubed. They are simply provided
 * as reference.

 * useful if you want to make the droppable "light up" when it can be
 * dropped on.
