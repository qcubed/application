/**
 * Class AccordionActivate
 *
 * The abstract AccordionActivate class defined here is
 * code-generated. The code to generate this file is
 * in the /tools/jquery_ui_gen/jq_control_gen.php file
 * and you can regenerate the files if you need to.
 *
 * The comments in this file are taken from the api reference site, so they do
 * not always make sense with regard to QCubed. They are simply provided
 * as reference.
 * Triggered after a panel has been activated (after animation
 * completes). If the accordion was previously collapsed, ui.oldHeader
 * and ui.oldPanel will be empty jQuery objects. If the accordion is
 * collapsing, ui.newHeader and ui.newPanel will be empty jQuery objects.
 * Note: Since the activate event is only fired on panel activation, it
 * is not fired for the initial panel when the accordion widget is
 * created. If you need a hook for widget creation use the create event.
