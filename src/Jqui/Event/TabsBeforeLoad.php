/**
 * Class TabsBeforeLoad
 *
 * The abstract TabsBeforeLoad class defined here is
 * code-generated. The code to generate this file is
 * in the /tools/jquery_ui_gen/jq_control_gen.php file
 * and you can regenerate the files if you need to.
 *
 * The comments in this file are taken from the api reference site, so they do
 * not always make sense with regard to QCubed. They are simply provided
 * as reference.
 * Triggered when a remote tab is about to be loaded, after the
 * beforeActivate event. Can be canceled to prevent the tab panel from
 * loading content; though the panel will still be activated. This event
 * is triggered just before the Ajax request is made, so modifications
 * can be made to ui.jqXHR and ui.ajaxSettings.
 * 
 * _Note: Although ui.ajaxSettings is provided and can be modified, some
 * of these properties have already been processed by jQuery. For
 * example, prefilters have been applied, data has been processed, and
 * type has been determined. The beforeLoad event occurs at the same
 * time, and therefore has the same restrictions, as the beforeSend
 * callback from jQuery.ajax()._
 *
