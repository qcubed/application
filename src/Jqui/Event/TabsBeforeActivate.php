 * Class TabsBeforeActivate
 *
 * The abstract TabsBeforeActivate class defined here is
 * code-generated. The code to generate this file is
 * in the /tools/jquery_ui_gen/jq_control_gen.php file
 * and you can regenerate the files if you need to.
 *
 * The comments in this file are taken from the api reference site, so they do
 * not always make sense with regard to QCubed. They are simply provided
 * as reference.
 * Triggered immediately before a tab is activated. Can be canceled to
 * prevent the tab from activating. If the tabs are currently collapsed,
 * ui.oldTab and ui.oldPanel will be empty jQuery objects. If the tabs
 * are collapsing, ui.newTab and ui.newPanel will be empty jQuery
 * objects.
 *
