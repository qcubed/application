/**
 * Command line script to recursively processes the given directory and outputs a PHP array
 * to send to the run_sed command that will help convert QCubed 3.x code to QCubed 4.0 code.
 * I originally tried to do this with sed for speed, but sed works differently on different OS's, so I am doing
 * it in PHP for consistency across OS's.
 *
 * Specifically this does the following:
 * - Hunts for @was docblock comments and makes a substituion for the new namespaced version of the function.
 * - Hunts for constants, and makes a substitution for a PascalCase version of the constant to the new constant.
 * - Outputs a var_dump format that can recreate the array of substitutions
 *
 * Use the resulting script carefully. Be sure to backup previous versions and compare changes before accepting them.
 *
 * The resulting script will be sent to stdout, so its expected you capture stdout to save it.
 *
 * Usage: gen_was dir > filename
