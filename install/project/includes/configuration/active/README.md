# The `active` directory

This directory contains configuration files that are automatically included every
time QCubed starts up. These files are designed to be altered and customized by you.

Our composer installer will add and removed files from this directory when a package
is installed or uninstalled.

New file names here should generally match the package name they came from, to avoid
name collissions.
